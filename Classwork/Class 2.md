## Using Python as a Calculator
1. Use the variables a,b, and c to store your age, and the age of the two people next to you.

Use python as a Calculator to take the mean of your three ages. (Remember, the mean is the sum of the three ages, divided by 3).


2. use the input function

```
color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
```

to let your neighbor input their favorite color. Then using the + operator, create a variable called sentence that stores the string "Your favorite color is " and the color they typed.

Print sentence.

3. use the input function to ask the user for their favorite number, store it in the variable num.

Then, cast (i.e. change the type of) num to the type float, using the float() constructor.

4. Everything is an object in Python, and each object has a unique ID...sort of like how you have a Social Security Number. Create two variables, a and b, and set them both equal to 7. Get their ids. Are they the same? or different?
